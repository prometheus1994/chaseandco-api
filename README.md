# Chase&Co. API
A backend RESTful API for Chase&amp;Co. created with Flask.

## Environment  
The environment for the API requires some dependencies you may not want to install globally.  
To setup the environment:  

  1. Start with installing a recent version of Python3.  
  2. Clone the API. 
  3. Create a virtual environment in the local parent directory of the API.  
     `python3 -m venv env`  
     `source env/bin/activate`  
  4. The API depends on Flask and Flask-Cors to handle requests.  
     `pip install Flask`  
     `pip install Flask-Cors`  
  5. The API should now have no dependency issues and your system shouldn't be cluttered with the dependencies.
